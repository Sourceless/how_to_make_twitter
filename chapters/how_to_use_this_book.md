# How to use this book

## What you need to know already
Before you start getting to grips with the content of this book, you should be fairly confident with computers. You'll need a laptop or desktop computer that you're allowed to install software on. It also helps if you already know how to program a little, but it's not 100% required.

If you have a computer with Linux or MacOS installed, great! If you're on Windows, then you'll need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux. I'd recommend installing the Ubuntu one, as it's the most commonly used linux distribution. You can find instructions to do this pretty easily by googling 'how to install ubuntu on windows'.

If you're a little more familiar with computers already, you can probably skip some of this section.

## What you need to get
### A text editor
To write code, we need to write and format raw text. The best way to do this is with a text editor. We can't use something like Microsoft Word because it puts lots of extra data in the files it produces, for instance about font and formatting. But for the computer to understand our programs, we'll need to use something that only puts text into a file.

While notepad will do, you'll be better off using something with a few more features. Atom, Notepad++, and Sublime Text are all well loved text editors.

## Terms that are used a lot
There's a few bits of jargon that will be used over and over again, so here's a handy reference:

### Terminal (or Console, or Command Line)
This is a program on your computer where you can interact with the computer via a text interface instead of a graphical one.

The reason we need it is because it's a lot more flexible that the point-and-click interface that you use day to day. While it's a little bit less friendly, you can achieve things with it that are otherwise difficult.

## Example code
Throughout this book there will be example code. Please make sure that you write it out in full, because it'll help you to learn. Sometimes example code won't run if you make a mistake when typing it up. This is normal! Computers can't second guess us (unfortunately), so you'll have to be very precise in what you write.

In addition, try to make sure you understand what the code you're writing is doing. The book will do its best to explain.

And finally, feel free to experiment! If you want to change how something works -- do it! Don't be afraid of breaking stuff -- it's the best way to learn.
