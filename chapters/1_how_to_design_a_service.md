# How to design a service

Whenever you build software and make it available for people to use, you're offering a service.
Sometimes those services are free, and other times they're paid-for. But all of these services are
designed to be used by people. And if you want people to use your service, you have to design it
with people in mind. This process is called Service Design.

## What is Service Design?
Service design is an approach to building software (and other services!) that puts people first.
It has several distinct steps:

1. Identifying who your users are
2. Finding out what they need
3. Prototyping
4. User Testing
5. Iterating on your design

Building services isn't a one-and-done kind of thing. You'll find that you need to start rough and
improve a little bit at a time to make something that is truly a joy to use.

## Why Service Design?
Why bother with all of this? You probably think you know what you're building already -- why not just
crack on with it?

The point of prototyping, researching, and iterating, is that it minimizes the thing that most often
kills big projects: building the wrong thing. Now, building the wrong thing does not mean that the thing
is useless -- just that it's not completely right.

By adding a bit at a time, experimenting and most importantly verifying that you're building the right
thing, you'll avoid wasting your (and others') time.

## Staged Approach
Service design is best accompanied by releasing and testing early and often. This way you can gather
feedback and incorporate it quickly.

Projects tend to follow a series of stages.
